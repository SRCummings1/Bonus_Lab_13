//1. Implement each one of the classes you see in the ﬁgure.You need to code the setters and getters, constructors.Add a method called “Play” at the GameCharacter class, which basically prints the Name of the Character and shows the strength and the intelligence.   
//2. You need to override the Play method at the Warrior, MagicUsingCharacter, and the Wizard classes.Each method should print  all the properties of that class (including the inherited ones).     
//3. In the main, create an array of type GameCharacter and call it “gameCharacters”, and then add: Two Warriors and three Wizards.After that, do a for loop to invoke the Play method for all the objects in that array.
